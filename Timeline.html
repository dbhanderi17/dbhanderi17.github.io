              For fun side project to develop a Tic Tac Toe game, utilizing
              Python for its simplicity and power. To create the graphical user
              interface, I used Tkinter, Python's standard GUI toolkit, which
              made it easy to design the game's windows, buttons, and messages.
              My game supports both single-player mode against a computer and
              multi-player mode for playing with friends. This endeavor not only
              allowed me to dive deep into Python and Tkinter but also gave me
              the satisfaction of bringing a classic game to life with a modern
              twist.
